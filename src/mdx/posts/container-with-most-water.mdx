# Problem

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

# Solution

Brute force solution

- Time complexity: $O(n^2)$
- Space complexity: $O(1)$

```jsx
const getMaxWaterContainer = heights => {
  let maxArea = 0;

  for (let p1 = 0; p1 < heights.length; p1++) {
    for (let p2 = p1+1; p2 < heights.length; p2++) {
      const height = Math.min(heights[p1], heights[p2]);
      const width = p2 - p1;
      const area = height * width;
      
      maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
    }
  }

  return maxArea;
};
```

Two pointer approach

- Time complexity: $O(n)$
- Space complexity: $O(1)$

```jsx
const getMaxWaterContainer = heights => {
  let maxArea = 0;
  let left = 0;
  let right = heights.length - 1;
  
  while (left < right) {
    const height = Math.min(heights[left], heights[right]);
    const width = right - left;
    const area = width * height;
    maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);

    if (heights[left] <= heights[right]) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }

  return maxArea;
};
```
