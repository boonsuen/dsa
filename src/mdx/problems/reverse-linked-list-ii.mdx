# Problem

Given a linked list and numbers m and n, return it back with only positions *m* to *n* in reverse.

## The Constraints

- Will *m* and *n* always be within the bounds of the linked list?
    - Yes, assume 1 ≤ *m* ≤ *n* ≤ length of linked list.
- Can we receive *m* and *n* values for the whole linked list?
    - Yes, we can receive *m* = 1 and *n* = length of linked list.

## Test Cases

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]

Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]

Input: head = [3,5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [3,5]

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 1, right = 5
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

# Solution

## Iterative Approach

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity: <InlineMath math="O(n)" />
- Space complexity: <InlineMath math="O(1)" />

```typescript
const reverseBetween = (
  head: ListNode | null,
  left: number,
  right: number
): (ListNode | null) => {
  let position = 1;
  let currentNode = head;
  let start = head;

  while (position < left) {
    start = currentNode;
    currentNode = currentNode.next;
    position++;
  }

  let prev = null; // for reversing the list
  let tail = currentNode;
  while (position >= left && position <= right) {
    const next = currentNode.next;
    currentNode.next = prev;
    prev = currentNode;
    currentNode = next;
    position++;
  }
  start.next = prev;
  tail.next = currentNode;

  if (left > 1) {
    return head;
  } else {
    return prev;
  }
};
```
