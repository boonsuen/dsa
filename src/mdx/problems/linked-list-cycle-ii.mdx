# Problem

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

# Solution

## Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm

The tortoise moves one step while the hare moves two steps until they meet together.
Once they are met together, we then initialize two pointers, one start from the head and one start from the meeting point.
Both pointers move one step at a time until they arrive at the same node.
This node is where the cycle begins.

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity: $O(n)$
- Space complexity: $O(1)$

```typescript
// Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm
const detectCycle = (head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null => {
  if (head === null) return null;

  let tortoise = head, hare = head;

  while (true) {
    tortoise = tortoise.next;
    hare = hare.next;
    if (hare === null || hare.next === null) {
      // No cycle
      return null;
    } else {
      hare = hare.next;
    }    

    if (tortoise === hare) break;
  }

  let p1 = head;
  let p2 = tortoise;
  while (p1 !== p2) {
    p1 = p1.next;
    p2 = p2.next;
  }
  return p1;
};
```
