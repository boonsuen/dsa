# Problem

Given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more child doubly linked lists of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

## Constraints

- Can a doubly linked list have multiple child list nodes?
    - Yes, every list node can have multiple levels of children.
- What do we do with child properties after flattening?
    - Just set the child property value to null.

## Test Cases

```jsx
1---2---3---4---5---6
    |           |  
    7---8---9   12--13
        |
        10--11

1-2-7-8-10-11-9-3-4-5-12-13-6
```

# Solution

## Iterative Approach

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity: $O(n)$
- Space complexity: $O(1)$

```typescript
const flatten = (head: Node | null): Node | null => {
  if (head === null) return head;

  let p = head;

  while (p !== null) {
    // Without child
    if (p.child === null) {
      p = p.next;
      continue;
    }
    // With child
    let tail = p.child;
    while (tail.next !== null) {
      tail = tail.next;
    }
    tail.next = p.next;

    if (p.next !== null) {
      p.next.prev = tail;
    }

    p.next = p.child;
    p.child.prev = p;
    p.child = null;
    p = p.next;
  }

  return head;
};
```
