# Problem

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

## The Constraints

- What do we return if we get null or a single node?
  - Just return null and the node back respectively.

# Solution

## Iterative Approach

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity: <InlineMath math="O(n)" />
- Space complexity: <InlineMath math="O(1)" />

```jsx
const reverseLinkedList = (head) => {
  let prev = null;
  let current = head;

  while (current) {
    let next = current.next;
    current.next = prev;
    prev = current;
    current = next;
  }
  
  return prev;
};
```
