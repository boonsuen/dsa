# About

My personal notes for [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/boonsuen/) problems.
## The Stack

This site is built with Next.js + MDX and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### MDX

MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast ðŸš€.

### Theme UI

[Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/home/) gives you a base set of [UI components](https://theme-ui.com/components) that let me style and layout web components with ease. The [sx prop](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop) is magic. No thinking about class names, the cascade or how my CSS is going to scale. Write your styles, then get minified, atomic classes and automatically generated [critical CSS](https://web.dev/extract-critical-css/) for your pages. Great for devs, and great for users.
