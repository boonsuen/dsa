# Data Structures & Algorithms
- A data structure is a format to organize, manage and store data in a way that allows efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
- An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.

## Examples of Data Structures
